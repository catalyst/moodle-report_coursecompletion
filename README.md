# About
This plugin allows you to report on course completions globally across a site, it currently has been tested for Moodle 3.1 and 3.2 with Mysql(MariaDB) or Postgresql

The report shows a different view depending on whether the logged in user is an admin or a student. An admin can see all records for all student. They can also filter results by firstname, lastname, email, and cohort. A student can only see their own course completion records and they can only filter by course or time.

Course completions must be configured and enabled properly for the courses you want to report on.

The report appears under the reports subsection of the site admin menu. Currently, students have no way via the navigation menu to access report. If you want students to be able to find the report, you must place a link in an HTML block on the student's dashboard.

The following search criteria are available

## User (admin only)
* Firstname
* Lastname
* Email
* Cohort (if any)
* Active user (not suspended or deleted)
* Suspended
* Deleted

## Course
* Category
* Name
* Completion State (Complete/Incomplete)

## Time completed/Time started
* Before time
* After time

Finally you can change the search conditions to be inclusive or exclusive (AND vs OR)


## Data displayed
The table shows the following data with pagination

* User's full name (sort by first/last and linked to profile) (admin view only)
* Email (admin view only)
* Course (linked to course)
* Timestarted
* Timecompleted
* Completion status (yes/no based on complete/incomplete)
